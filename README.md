# billiards-game-test-005

## Project Brief
Create a single HTML/CSS/JS application that displays a top-down view of a pool table (billiards) with a cue ball and two object balls. The user must be able to click and drag to aim and set the power of the shot. The balls should move with simple collision detection and friction, and the cue ball should be reset after each shot. Include a stroke counter.
